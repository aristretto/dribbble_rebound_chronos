- run the following:
    - `bower install` (install front-end dependencies)
    - `npm install` (install node dependencies)
    - `coffee -c gulpfile.coffee` (make the gulpfile)

    - `gulp`.  This will start up a lightweight server, and compile + watch your .scss, .coffee, and image files
    - `gulp build`.  This will do everything gulp does, minus starting up a server.
